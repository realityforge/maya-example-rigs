---------- INSTRUCTIONS

Download the .zip file and unzip the contents, retaining the hierarchy such that the folder structure has the textures folder at the same level as the main Maya file AZRI.ma so the textures load correctly. See the AZRI Rig Basics and Extras tutorials for more details on the unique features of this rig at www.gameanim.com/book/tutorials/
